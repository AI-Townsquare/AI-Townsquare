                &quot;CoolTech&#39;s software engineers develop the next-generation technologies that change how millions of users connect, explore, and interact with information and one another. Youâ€™ll be working in a cross-functional
                team, which is empowered to rapidly iterate and release new features. We need our engineers to be versatile, display leadership and management qualities and be enthusiastic to take on new problems across the full-stack as we
                continue to push technology forward. An ideal candidate will have continuous experience in JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.&quot; Once the job advert is out, you start getting hundreds of CVs. So you need to design the automated
                system to screen the candidates. [[First thing you do is list the top characteristics you&#39;re hiring for]]

                There are three key characteristics you look for in candidates: 1) Technical skills in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript 2) Management experience 3) No career gaps (continuous work experience) Now, let&#39;s explore what happens when
                you prioritise one of these characteristics when designing the automated system. Choose which characteristic you&#39;d like to prioritise when making the hiring decisions: [[Technical skills]] [[Management experience]] [[No

                Technical skills are crucial to Cooltech. However, CoolTech values fairness and wants its automated recruitment system to be fair. There are two fairness techniques the company uses. 1) Demographic parity - guarantees
                proportional representation (If 30% of the candidates are women, then 30% of hires will be women) 2) Equality of Opportunity - if qualified, candidates have the same % of getting hired irregardless of gender, race, age

                Jane Lo is hired! The machine prioritised: - Technical skills - Demographic parity fairness technique Explanation: 70% of applicants were male, and 30% of applicants were female. Applying this fairness technique does not
                guarantee that all candidates have strong technical skills. In this case the model randomly selected from the applicant pool of women, so although Jane Lo did not have strong technical skills, she was hired anyway. Questions
